## Installing
Add to your LocalSettings.php
```
wfLoadSkin( 'smfcurve2' );
```

To set as the default skin:
```
$wgDefaultSkin = "smfcurve2";
```

## Customizing
We provide a few simple and more advanced methods to customizing the skin.

### Simple
Add to your LocalSettings.php (After your wfLoadSkin line)

#### Connecting to SMF SSI.
Needed for adding the forum news and main menu.
```
$wgsmfRoot = '/path/to/forum';
```

#### Adding the forum news
```
$wgshowSMFnews = true;
```

#### Adding the forum main menu
```
$wgshowSMFmenu = true;
```

#### Adding the Wiki logo where the SMF logo shows
```
$wguseLogoImage = true;
```

#### Adding the search to the sidebar
```
$wguseSideSearchBox = true;
```

### Advanced
To do more advance customizing, several files can be changed.  However they are designed to allow extending the base skin.

First set in your LocalSettings.php
```
$wgDefaultSkin = "smfcurve2custom";
```

You can modify the following files depending on your needs:
- /inclues/smfCurve2SkinCustom.php
- /inclues/smfCurve2TemplateCustom.php
- /resources/script/custom.js
- /resources/css/custom.css

We have included some sample code to show how modifications may be made.
